6. Run `npm run lighthouse:dev` or `npm run lighthouse:sit` or `npm run lighthouse:uat` or `npm run lighthouse:prod` to start running the project

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run a tests:
In **package.json**, You can find the collection of **scripts** member -> an object hash that contains commands to be executed at various points in the lifecycle of your package. These scripts are typically run using `npm` or `yarn` commands.
#### Example:
* **"npm run lighthouse:dev"**: "node features/script/performanceLighthouseScore.js DEV"
    * This script runs when you execute lighthouse in DEV
* **"npm run lighthouse:sit"**: "node features/script/performanceLighthouseScore.js SIT"
    * This script runs when you execute lighthouse in SIT
* **"npm run lighthouse:uat"**: "node features/script/performanceLighthouseScore.js UAT"
    * This script runs when you execute lighthouse in UAT
* **"npm run lighthouse:prod"**: "node features/script/performanceLighthouseScore.js PROD"
    * This script runs when you execute lighthouse in PROD
